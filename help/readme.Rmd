# ProteomeExpert-QC

## Parameters
### QC

'QC' allow to show the quality of your protein matrix that measured by missing value ratio and reproducibility (Pearson Correlation). The objective protein matrix data is requiried to be uploaded in the step of 'Data Console - select your protein file' before starting this step. `Select matrix` select uploadedProMatrix as the matrix to be analyzed, and `Select your interesting column name` as your interesting attribute which will count the number of proteins hierarchy accoroding to the non missing ratio of each protein. Then choose `MissingValueExplore` and `Reproducibility` as the modules you want to process.
`MissValueExplore` module design to explore missing data distributions, focusing on numeric missing data. The report show missing data distributions in different tissue/disease types and show distributions in each row (proteins) and each column (samples).
`Reproducibility` module design to explore correlations between each sample use Pearson Correlation.

## Tutorial

1. Select `uploadedProMatrix` as the matrix to be analyzed.
2. Select `MissValueExplore` and `Reproducibility` as modules you want to process. click on `Submit`, results would be shown on the right side on the page.
